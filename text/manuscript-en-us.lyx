Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hello dear reader.
 Thank you for taking a hold of this treatise.
 Let it take you on a journey of discovery through the food chain.
 You're going to learn a lot about the costs of the food we consume.
 This will give you an insight into where, among other things, agriculture
 has an impact.
 For the farmers among you, it can also provide arguments to justify your
 price.

\begin_layout Section
The conception of this paper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is a child of the Landwijzer training to become a biodynamic
 farmer.
 What was the motivation for me to start that training and then choose this
 topic?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for starting the training was a concern about the state of our
 Earth.
 Call it a mid-live crisis, but around my 45

I wanted to realize something really good.
 Something that lets you say:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But why agriculture when I was all about computer science? That's a process
 that had been going on for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It all started after I got in touch with the Transition movement

 From here permaculture came on my path and so the interest in agriculture
 grew.

 inspired me: a project with beauty, permaculture, improvement of nature
 and also commercially viable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agriculture is super important, of course.
 A smartphone is something we can actually do without, but not food.
 Just read 
\begin_inset Quotes pld

 In it he argues that a society cannot continue to exist if nature is destroyed.
 And given the close relationship between nature and agriculture

Many are trying to reduce the impact of agriculture on the world.
 But can't we use agriculture to heal the damage already inflicted instead
 of being happy just to do less damage? That has become my mission.

 In it she mentions, after removing a sandwich from its plastic coffin,
 that in order to put 1 calorie of the sandwich in your mouth, it takes
 a total of 10 calories of oil.
 This is a statement that comes up regularly in permaculture.

There are other propositions that you'll also find on a regular basis:

\begin_layout Standard
With my scientific background, I was stimulated.
 Where do these numbers come from? What do they mean? Aren't they being
 misused?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By coincidence, clues came my way regarding the source of Rebecca Hosking's
 statement.
 After some exciting (?) detective work, it was possible to sink my teeth
 into that sandwich's energy.

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, over the years, the realization grew that organic food
 is not expensive.
 It is the current mainstream food that is too cheap.
 Why? Because there are more costs in conventional food that are not passed
 on (e.g.
 loss of biodiversity, health impact of pesticides,
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots
) compared to organic farming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But which costs are there in agriculture (conventional and organic)? How
 are they calculated? Do they have a big impact or not? The scientist in
 me wants to know, which is why I felt the urge to delve into this.
 In this way, bio and non-bio can be compared in a more objective way.

g of grain is needed.
 Nature gives us a lot of free energy through sunlight, but conventional
 agriculture gives additional inputs to the grain.
 In Leach's study, he identifies the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
fuel for tractor and other machinery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
fertilizer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chemical pesticides.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This requires a total of 4.02
\begin_inset space ~

MJ for the given amount of grain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's dwell on this list for a moment.
 Typically, only the fuel for the tractor and other machinery is included,
 as well as the fuel required for drying grain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But fertilizers and pesticides also require fuels.
 Both within factories to create them, within mining (e.g.
 phosphorus and potash mines for the P and K of fertilizer) but also as
 a raw material itself (the N of fertilizer is extracted from natural gas).
 This indirect use of fuels must also be included.
 In this case, even more indirect fuels are used than direct ones.

\begin_layout Standard
So there are additional processes to look at before we can speak of a loaf
 of bread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the grain must be milled.
 This requires energy from the milling process, there is transportation
 to the mill, the grain and flour must be packaged, the plant and machines
 must be maintained, you need offices that must be lit,

Next, the bread must be baked.
 The baking process itself requires (a lot of) energy.
 Besides this, energy is needed again for transport, packaging, maintenance
 of machines and buildings,

 The figures are the percentages of energy required for that particular
 category.
 So you see that agriculture itself only requires 20% of the entire energy
 picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, bread has an EROEI of 10.6:20.7 or 1:1.9.
 In other words, almost twice as much energy must be spent to sell a loaf
 in the store than comes out in nutritional value!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's not even considering the transportation from the store to home.
 Leach indicates that if the store is 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

km away and you take the car just to go get a loaf of bread, there is still
 8
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

MJ has to be added.
 Here the EROEI drops even further to 1:2.7.
 So taking the car instead of going by bike or on foot lowers the energy
 efficiency from about 1:2 to 1:3!
\end_layout

Now, with a loaf of bread, not everything is said about agriculture and
 the food system.
 Let's see what can be found in the studies around energetic inputs.

One factor I do want to highlight is the energy stored in materials.
 For example, if you take a wall, energy has been required on many levels
 to create it.
 To make the brick, you have to mine raw materials such as clay.
 These must then be transported after which the brick is pressed into a
 form and baked.
 For baking and transport, ovens and trucks are needed, and the energy used
 for this particle must also be attributed to the brick.
 Further is transportation and storage before it arrives at the construction
 site.
 Then there is cement used to make the wall, scaffolding and mortar.
 Adding all this up, along with a few more factors that I'm just losing
 track of right now, shows how much energy was actually required to make
 the wall.

 Depending on how many people you allocate to agriculture (direct and indirect

 This is consistent with heavy industry which uses between 170 and 300

The EROEI of agriculture in the UK, according to Leach's calculations, fell
 from 1:2.2 in 1952 to 1:2.9 in 1968.
 So in 1968 it took 3 calories of energy to produce 1 calorie of food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leach sees the reason for this primarily in the use of animal feed.
 He has found that only 6% of the energetic output of plant agriculture
 goes directly to the consumer.
 The rest is all used as livestock feed.
 At the end of the day, only 12% of the energetic output of agriculture
 (both plant and animal) is available for human consumption.

Is it bad, however, that so much goes to animals? Leach points out that
 animals are useful:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they provide essential nutrients,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they process agricultural products that humans cannot digest (grass, hay,
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they help maintain soil fertility, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they can be used on soils that are otherwise unusable (too wet, too steep,

 That's about 1/3 of the agricultural area in the UK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, trop is too much and too much is trop.
 Halving meat consumption would make the UK self-sufficient and increase
 EROEI to 1:1.4.
 That's quite apart from the health benefits that would occur.

\begin_layout Standard
A number of factors such as fuels (direct inputs), fertilizer and steel
 have been discussed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new factor is irrigation which, as we see, for the USA accounts for 6
 to 12% of the agricultural energy budget (pumping and distributing water).
 This is a factor that did not surface with Leach and Meino Smit.
 Probably because the Netherlands and the UK are rather wet countries, while
 in the USA agriculture is done in very dry parts.
 What we have seen in recent years is that the importance of irrigation
 is also increasing here.
 Accordingly, this will also form an increasingly important part of the
 energy input of agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lovins 
\emph on
et al.

\emph default
 indicate that with irrigation there can be a problem of increased energy
 requirements.
 If you pump out more than is naturally replenished, you will have to pump
 in from deeper layers in subsequent years.
 This requires not only extra energy for pumping, but also for the heavier
 infrastructure (extraction and production of raw materials).
 This is quite apart from the ecological impact on the wider environment
 that pumping from deeper layers has.
 The need to pump from deeper layers is a trend that we have also noticed
 in Flanders in recent years.
 It is important to reverse this as soon as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also striking that cattle feed is not included.
 This is an important part of the energy balance of agriculture in both
 the Netherlands and the UK.
 For the reason for this I have but to guess.
 Have they not considered this? Is the US self-sufficient in feed? The latter
 is contradicted by Lovins 
\emph on

 who attribute 7% of the energy input to this.

 The input here is the input to the entire food system (i.e., not just agriculture
).
 The first figure shows that with increased inputs, there was first a sharp
 increase in the output of agriculture.
 At the same time, there has been a sharp decline in the labor hours required
 on the farm.
 This was obviously due to the industrialization of agriculture (increased
 use of fertilizers, pesticides and machinery).
 This increase peaked in the late 1950s.
 After that, we see that the increase becomes less with increased input
 until there is a tendency for this to almost level off: additional input
 gives a much smaller output.
 In the field of pesticides, Lovins 
\emph on
et al.

\emph default
 indicate that there is even a negative trend: in 1948, 7% of the crop was
 lost to insects.
 In the early 1980s, 6 times as many pesticides were used, but 13% of the
 crop was lost to insects.

 where you see that there was a decline in the efficiency of Dutch agriculture
 between 1950 and 1970 after which the efficiency leveled off.
 In other words, putting an extra MJ into agriculture had twice the effect

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that there are very many factors to consider in order to know
 the full cost of agriculture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just looking at the directly consumed energy does not give the full picture.
 Especially since we see that the indirect energy needed for agriculture
 has become greater than the direct energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Factors that I personally have noticed strongly are animal feed, mining,
 electronics, drying and irrigation.
 It is also striking that the contribution of artificial fertilizer in the
 Netherlands has decreased enormously in recent decades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is also striking is that until the 1970s there was a huge increase
 in inputs that went hand in hand with a decline in energy efficiency.
 The increase in input then continued to grow more slowly, while the efficiency
 stabilized.
 All in all, we see that more and more energy is being pumped into agriculture,
 but that yields do not follow suit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We actually consume more energy in agriculture than we produce.
 In the Netherlands by a factor of two, in the UK even by a factor of three.
 Since food is a pure basic need, it is temporarily justifiable to pump
 more energy into it than you get out of it.
 But that is not a strategy that can be sustained over the long term.
 What do you do when energy becomes scarce? This can be due not only to
 depletion of oil wells but also to geopolitical situations where the supply
 of energy stagnates

 It is therefore important for the stability of a country to strive to ensure
 that its agriculture is as energy efficient as possible, taking into account
 all the factors that have an influence.
 It is a pity that this is not recognized today and therefore we continue
 on a path of increasing energy dependence.

With the replacement of muscle power by mechanization, it has now become
 difficult to make the reverse.
 First, there are far fewer people working in agriculture so there is less
 muscle power.
 In fact, the use of animal muscle power has all but disappeared.
 On top of that, the direct energy required has also increased over time.
 This means that there should be more people and animals working in agriculture
 compared to the era before the industrialization of agriculture.

The path between the farm and the plate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the farm and the plate there are roughly 3 steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
food processing.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

These include pressing to juice, making sausages, grinding grain, preparing
 lasagna, canning or glassing,

Also known as the distribution sector.
 This is where food is transported, stored, and sold in stores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use of food.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

These are households, restaurants,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots

\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

.
 In the example of bread, we have seen an extreme situation where transportation
 between the store and home takes almost half the extra energy.
 But there are more factors at play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course there is transport between the farm and processing.
 Products are also shipped internally (e.g., the flour to the baker).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the energetic input does not stop here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You have the actual processing (milling, baking, cooking, drying, steaming,
 pressing, freeze drying,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Energy is also needed to make and maintain buildings and machines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is striking is that the energy costs of packaging are reasonably high.
 For canned goods in particular, the energy required is as high as 25% of
 the energy needed for processing!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The picture becomes somewhat more difficult because you also have to take
 into account residual flows from processing that go to agriculture, usually
 in the form of animal feed.
 Some of it is also destined directly for export and therefore does not
 need to be included.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be expected, most of the energy (about half) is due to transportation.
 Further energy is needed for storage (buildings and refrigeration), packaging
 (e.g.
 washing bins or repackaging as a private label), heating of offices and
 warehouses, retail buildings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What struck me very hard is that the refrigeration needed to keep food and
 cook it requires so much energy.
 Together with the energy needed to make appliances like refrigerators,
 kitchen robots, microwave ovens and the infrastructure like a kitchen or
 storage room, we have to count an extra 30% to 40% on top of the energy
 needed in the chain up to that point!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Food losses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This explains why it is so important to minimize food losses.
 For example, if at the end of the chain half a jar of ravioli is thrown
 in the garbage, this is not only a loss of ravioli itself, but also of
 all the energy that has been put into it up to that point, from the farmer
 to the processor, driver and retailer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leach outlines the types of food loss he sees:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
losses inherent in the process.
 These are, for example, harvest losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
losses that are unavoidable.
 For example, the weight of eggs includes the eggshell which, however, cannot
 be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
losses that are typical.
 For example, these are the peels of vegetables that are not used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
losses due to carelessness.
 These are, for example, discarded meals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three types are usually included in studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unavoidable and typical losses can only be dealt with if new outlets are
 created.
 Consider, for example, the rise of mushroom cultivation on coffee grounds
 or the use of cocoa shells as a ground cover.
 Ideas for this can certainly be drawn from the past where, for example,
 every part of an animal was used.
 This ranged from using the skin in clothing (leather), hair in brushes
 (shaving brushes made of pig hair) or construction (horse hair in mud walls)
 over eating organ meat to bone glue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can reduce the other two loss factors much faster and more actively.
 This is such an important topic that the FAO has even devoted a complete
 study to it

 Here agriculture has a share of 25% and processing a share of 40%.
 The large share of cooling and cooking at home is also evident (about 22%

\begin_layout Standard
If energy use in the food chain is to come down, it is clear where the biggest
 gains can be found:

\begin_layout Itemize
a chain that is as short as possible so that the impact of processing is
 reduced.
\begin_inset Newline newline

This will mean a shift to more individual transport and cooking.
 But we gain energy because a lot of packaging is eliminated (10% of total
 energy consumption) and because things do not have to be kept in a refrigerator
 as long.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Consider, for example, that ravioli from above.
 It first has to be prepared in a factory, is served in an aluminum dish,
 has to be cooled all the time (both in the store and at home) and then
 reheated at home.
 If we prepare it at home directly from lasagna leaves and fresh products,
 I think it will require much less energy and be more nutritious and tasty.

Leach's work suggests that the more energy comes from muscle power (human

 From the studies, we can only say something about energy and land use.

 Soybeans are about on the borderline.

 Of course, one could argue that modern, non-land-based, industrial livestock

The question is, of course, whether we are better off today.
 It is said that there is only a 3-day supply available if all import or

 Whether this is really true we will leave to one side, but it is clear
 that a situation such as a lockdown or war immediately causes panic.
 So there is not much confidence in the self-sufficiency of the food chain.

 We can do this by growing crops whose consumption can be staggered.
 This is either because they can be stored for a long time (tuber and root
 crops, cereals, cabbages) or because the slaughter can be staggered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Social status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So you would think that a system like the one in ancient China would be
 ideal.
 However, if you read King's account, it seeps in that the farmers were
 at the bottom of the social ladder.
 Also, the intensity of this system required many farmers.
 An average plot was 0.25
\begin_inset space ~

ha! So it took a very large number of farmers to feed the population.
 As you can calculate, there was 1 farmer for every 17 inhabitants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we want to introduce such a system here, it is necessary to encourage
 many people to go back into farming.
 That social position and prestige of farmers improve will be an important
 factor for this.

\begin_layout Standard
It is striking how much difference there is between different farming systems.

We now have two criteria that an agricultural system must meet in order
 to achieve an energy neutral food system on the one hand (EROEI above 3:1)
 and on the other hand to ensure that we can be self-sufficient (yield above

Meino Smit, for example, cites a number of studies that have calculated
 the social costs of agriculture.
 These run from environmental damage (estimated at €

billion per year) over the social costs of livestock farming (more than
\begin_inset space ~

 (between €

billion per year).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are sums that make you stop and think.
 Especially since Meino Smit calculates that the agricultural income (net

 billion.

 The social costs are therefore of the same order of magnitude as the income
 from agriculture.
 Or to put it another way, our way of doing agriculture is possibly socially
 economically unprofitable.

Expressing sustainability in terms of money strikes me as odd.
 The monetary value of a product or service is subject to laws that have
 little to do with physical reality.
 What is the value of a ton

? In the physical world, its impact is fixed, independent of any speculation.
 But the monetary value is not fixed.
 Meino Smit, for example, cites a value between €

Finally, I find the entire study rather homocentric.
 Nowhere does it look at the impact on other organisms unless humans benefit.

\begin_layout Standard
It is my dream that there can be an indicator of sustainability.
 As is clear, this is not possible by bundling everything together in one
 parameter because there are so many factors that come into play.
 For example, how do you weigh a farmer's wages against water management?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we need to work with an indicator that highlights the impact
 on different aspects in a visible way.
 In this way, the user is more fully informed and can himself weigh up which
 factor plays a greater or lesser role in the assessment.
 This consideration will depend on the context in which the user lives.
 This subjective assessment should not be imposed but each user should be
 able to make it for himself together with clear information about the aspects
 being measured.

This is a first step towards such an indicator.
 As can be seen, there are a number of facets that would systematically

 there are several facets so the overall impression can still be positive.

\begin_layout Part
What do we learn from this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Impact of indirect costs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important message that Meino Smit brings us is that if you only look
 at direct costs, you will get a distorted picture of the evolution of agricultu
re.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a way of measuring the evolution of agriculture, two indicators are regularly
 used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
how many hectares can a farmer cultivate annually
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
how many tons of food can a farmer grow annually
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Meino Smit, however, these are not the best indicators.
 He prefers to work with energy-based indicators because they better capture
 the social costs of agriculture.
 Examples are energy efficiency (EROEI), energy output per full-time equivalent
 (FTE) or energy output per hectare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, it also considers whether the increase in energetic costs is
 proportional to the output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A word of warning: this is the chapter with the most numbers and graphs.
 If that's not your thing, here are the most striking figures (note, if
 you want to stay in suspense you'll have to skip this one).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, let's summarize what has been found so far.
 These are conservative estimates so probably the ratios are worse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For every MJ directly attributed to western agriculture, there are still
 1 to 2
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

MJ of indirect energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To produce 1 calorie (or MJ) of food, mainstream agriculture needs between
 2 and 3
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

calories of energy.
 This is separate from the rest of our food chain (all together, to produce
 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

calorie to eat between 7 and 12
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

calories).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For every Dutch farmer, there are 1.7 other individuals working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For every hectare of farmland worked in the Netherlands, another 1.7 hectares
 are needed abroad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we combine these numbers, new insights emerge:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Between 1950 and 2015, the energetic input per hectare in the Netherlands
 increased by 620%.
 The energetic output per hectare used increased by only 10%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Between 1950 and 2015, the energetic input per Dutch farmer increased by
 2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

500% (!).
 Output per FTE increased by 320% during that period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
between 1950 and 2015, yield in tons per hectare increased by 30%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The classic indicators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Number of hectares cultivated per full-time equivalent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If only direct labor hours and land use are taken, then between 1950 and
 2015 the number of hectares/FTE increased from about 4 hectares/FTE to
 16 hectares/FTE, a factor of 3.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you look at the total labor hours spent, so including mining, livestock,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots
, then between 1950 and 2015 the number of ha/FTE increased from about 4
 ha/FTE to 6 ha/FTE, a factor of 1.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So much for what Meino Smit used.
 However, in my opinion, total land use should also be included because
 land is also used for indirect labor.
 If you do that, then the increase between 1950 and 2015 happens to be the
 same as in the first calculation: a factor of 3.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this is also shown in figure

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So you notice two things:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
including indirect contributions does affect the efficiency increase in
 agriculture.
 In general, efficiency decreases when indirect contributions are included.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it's important to think carefully about what you include and what you don't.

\begin_layout Standard
However, if indirect inputs are not taken into account, the EROEI in 2015
 would be 1:1.
 This is a big difference because instead of appearing to be energy neutral,
 however, agriculture is demanding more energy than we are getting out.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is particularly striking is that the increase in input is much greater
 than that in output.
 If you compare these increases, you notice that this trend is getting worse.
 In other words, despite the stories around increasing efficiency in agriculture
, more and more energy has to be put into it for a meager increase in output.
 This is generally not visible because of the limited inclusion of the increase
 in inputs.

These changes mean that many more people need to be employed in agriculture
 and indirect costs will fall sharply.
 The most important key figures also come in green.
 It is striking that clearly more energy is taken out of agriculture than
 is put into it.
 Energetically, we have a positive situation again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A big exception is the total amount of agricultural land per inhabitant.
 Whereas this currently hovers around 30 ares/inhabits, in the proposed
 scenario it will drop to 12 ares/inhabits, below the minimum limit of 14
 ares/inhabits.
 Won't that put us in dangerous waters?

This change in agriculture will require a new influx of farmers with new

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible consequence of this change is that the price of agricultural
 products increases.
 But this is only the case if the social costs are not taken into account.
 If these were to fall significantly, wouldn't society be better off? However,
 getting this message across is very difficult as we have seen in France
 with the Yellow Rashes.

Meino Smit makes the case that if there had been a policy in 1950 that took
 all costs into account, we would be better off now.
 Breeding has caused an output increase of 20 to 25%.
 Partly because of this and through innovation that would have focused more
 on better working conditions with less use of energy and raw materials,
 for example through improved hand tools, agriculture could have achieved
 an output increase that was greater than today without the hallucinatory
 increase in input.
 Agriculture would have been more robust and there would be more farmers
 and greater social support.

Has my dream changed?

My goal in starting the training is to bring the system of Ferme du Bec
 Hellouin to Flanders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the study work around this paper, it has become clear that there
 is a real need for agriculture that repairs the damage done.
 We have seen that kitchen gardens and especially the Chinese agriculture
 of 1930 can be great sources of inspiration here.
 The system of Ferme du Bec Hellouin uses the same principles of combined
 cultivation, intense follow-up, high input of organic fertilizers combined
 with not disturbing the soil, permanent cover and many other factors to
 optimize the natural processes.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Within the Chinese agriculture of 1930, cattle breeding was done in an extensive
 way, which is still missing at Ferme du Bec Hellouin.
 Also arable farming is missing, but we have seen that for cereals the current
 way of arable farming already gives good figures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the experience I already had with the combination crops of Ferme du
 Bec Hellouin, I could reflect during the drafting of this paper what this
 system does around the different identified costs such as water, ecology,

This search for the true cost of food started with a search for the origin
 of the boutade

\begin_inset Quotes prd
\end_inset

.
 There was also the suspicion that it is not so much that organic food is
 expensive, but that, compared to organic food, conventional food has more
 indirect costs that are less reflected in the final price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the Eosta study distinguishes between organic and non-organic and shows
 that organic has lower social costs.
 All other studies look at the totality of the food chain without making
 a distinction between organic and non-bio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that agriculture indeed bears very high indirect energy costs.
 These range from feed and fertilizer over the cost of buildings and machinery
 to things like mining, electronics and services.
 There are also costs in many other areas such as labor, water, land use
 and you name it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct costs remain the main chunk, but indirect costs have increased dramatical
ly over the last 50 years until they outpace direct costs.
 In indirect costs, livestock feed takes up a particularly important share.
 What I have also noticed are the contributions of mining, grain and grass
 drying, and irrigation in the energy balance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further down the food chain, packaging and household use particularly stood
 out, with an energetic share equivalent to that of agriculture itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The share of agriculture in the energy consumption of the total food chain
 is a quarter or less.

That you need 10 times more energy than you consume turns out to be true.
 Such a thing is not sustainable in the long run because the supply of energy
 is finite.
 The same problem applies to other costs as well.

If we compare the energy efficiency of different farming systems, we can

Among the industrial farming systems, animal production or heated greenhouse
 systems are far too strong energy devourers.
 Arable systems come out better.
\end_layout

Pre- and semi-industrial farming systems often turn out to be energetically
 advantageous but many of these are not possible in our area due to high
 population density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best candidates for a future agriculture is horticulture as practiced
 in China until the beginning of the last century.
 This was possible because of the intensive attention of the farmer together
 with a large supply of nutrients, combination crops and an intensive follow-up
 of crops.

The principles that make the old horticulture from China so strong can also
 be found in the system of Ferme du Bec Hellouin.
 However, this system still needs to be developed further.
 In its present form, the emphasis is very much on the cultivation of fine
 vegetables.
 Therefore, it cannot offer a complete answer.
 But its further development can provide inspiration for other branches
 of agriculture to go to
