Ferme du Bec Hellouin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is clear, I'm a big fan of Ferme du Bec Hellouin.
 For those not familiar with it, here a little description as I see it.
 You can also watch the documentary film

 to get acquainted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ferme du Bec Hellouin is located in Normandy, about 20
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

km southwest of Rouen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What appeals to me most about this system is the combination of their vision
 and the published economic results.

\begin_layout Section
Their vision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The start of Ferme du Bec Hellouin was the desire of Charles and Perrine
 Herv√©-Gruyer to produce all the food for their family themselves in a way
 that does not burden the earth.
 This means: a minimum input of fossil fuels, producing as much as possible
 themselves, an agriculture that nourishes the earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first goal is minimizing fossil fuels.
 They do have a small tractor but only use it for larger infrastructure
 works or turning the compost pile.
 There is also an indirect use of fossil fuels from the plastic of the greenhous
es, the supply of materials (such as horse manure), deliveries,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots

\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

.
 So they are not completely independent of fossil fuels, but try to minimize
 the use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They want to produce as much as possible themselves.
 Not only vegetables, but also commodities such as firewood.
 They have their own blacksmith shop, Charles does his own joinery and they
 make their own biochar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their agriculture feeds the earth.
 There is an enormous amount of biodiversity in their fields.
 Not only because of the variety of vegetables, but also because of the
 opportunities they offer to nature.
 Bees and birds are seen that are barely seen elsewhere in France.
 Year after year, they build up carbon in the soil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond these aspects, I find their sense of beauty hugely inspiring.
 The whole estate is worthy of a painting.
 An artistic sense is also clearly present in their own publications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In their book 
\begin_inset Quotes pld
\end_inset

Miraculous Abundance
\begin_inset Quotes prd
\end_inset

 they have a vision on micro-farming that strongly appeals to me.
 Especially in a Flemish context, it is important to be able to work on
 small plots.
 And this while the prevailing trend is still towards an increase in scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, they are very grounded in their approach.
 It is no-nonsense and they are very clear: farming is work, hard work and
 even harder work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Economic results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As one of the few permaculture companies, their numbers have been scientifically
 mapped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A study by INRA (comparable to ILVO in Flanders) looked at the yield of
 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

ha net cultivation area.
 This yield increased over the course of the study from 30 to 55
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

000
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Euros per year.
 Obviously there are many discussions around this but it gives a direction.
 Especially since there are already several farms in France that have successful
ly adopted their system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How many similar projects have failed and why is unfortunately less clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Relevance to this work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned elsewhere, the system of the Chinese agriculture from the 1930s
 appears to be a very good basis from which to start an agriculture that
 produces more energy than it takes to feed Flanders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strengths of the Chinese agriculture from the 1930s can also be found
 at Ferme du Bec Hellouin:

\begin_layout Standard
Through various paths, these principles came to Ferme du Bec Hellouin.
 Most remarkably, these principles were also used in 19th century Parisian
 urban agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With additional principles such as not turning the soil, leaving as much
 as possible in situ, making paths part of the system,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots
 additional steps were taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although there are no figures available about energetic input and output,
 it is to be assumed that their system will approach the figures of the
 Chinese agriculture of the 1930s.
 Hence, it's a good start for agriculture that both yields more energy than
 you put into it and is productive enough to feed many people on a small
 area.

\begin_layout Standard
An estimated 4 people work here full time.
 There is also an administrative assistant and a cook, but it is unclear
 from which part of the company these are paid (there is also a research
 center and an educational branch).
