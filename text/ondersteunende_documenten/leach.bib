	abstractnote = {An investigation into the growth of energy use in the food system is presented. An attempt is made to compare the present food supply system, in energy measures, with those of other societies and with the U. S. past. The energy provided by the sun is omitted in the survey, but the other factors considered are fuel (direct use), electricity, fertilizer, agricultural steel, farm machinery, tractors, irrigation, food processing industry and machinery, paper packaging, glass containers, steel cans and aluminum, transport (fuel), trucks and trailers, commercial refrigeration and cooking, refrigeration machinery (home and Commercial), home refrigeration and cooking. Private delivery by the individual is not included. Energy subsidies for various food crops are shown in various countries and compared with the U. S. food system. In primitive cultures, 5 to 50 food calories were obtained for each calorie of energy invested. Industrialized food systems require 5 to 10 calories to obtain 1 food calorie. An analysis of the energy flow in the food system illustrates features of the food system unrealized in a usual economic analysis. (32 references) (MCW)},
